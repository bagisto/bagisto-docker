### What is Docker?

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. Docker can also be used for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using Docker-Compose tool.

With the help of docker-compose, one can define containers to be built, their configuration, links, volumes, ports etc in a single file and it gets launched by a single command. One can add multiple servers and services just by adding them to docker-compose configuration file. This configuration file is in YAML format.

## System Requirements

- System/Server requirements of Bagisto are mentioned [here](https://github.com/bagisto/bagisto#2-requirements-). Using Docker, these requirements will be fulfilled by docker images of apache & mysql, and our application will run in a multi-tier architecture.

- Install latest version of Docker and Docker Compose if it is not already installed. Docker supports Linux, MacOS and Windows Operating System. Click [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to find their installation guide.
