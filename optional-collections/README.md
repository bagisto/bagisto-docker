# Optional Collection

You just need to copy one of the folders of your choice or flavor. Inside that folder, you need to run only one command i.e.,

~~~sh
sh execute.sh
~~~

Done! No need to do anything.

It will ask you only one question, whether you want us to install everything for you or you want to install it on your own from Bagisto's GUI.

If you select yes, then everything will set up for you and if you select no, then we assume that you are familiar with docker and you can set up your project manually by Bagisto's GUI or by entering the command line of the container.
